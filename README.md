# Big Data Engineering Portfolio

Hi! I’m **Kaushal** — a data engineer focused on building reliable data pipelines and working with large-scale processing systems (Hadoop/MapReduce-style workloads, NoSQL, and batch analytics).

This repository is a curated portfolio of my **big data engineering projects, exercises, and implementations**, primarily in **Java** with some **PigLatin**.

## 📌 What you’ll find here

### 1) Advanced Hadoop / MapReduce Algorithms
**Folder:** [`Advances Hadoop Algorithms`](./Advances%20Hadoop%20Algorithms)  
A collection of implementations and experiments around Hadoop/MapReduce concepts and algorithms.

**Highlights (suggested):**
- MapReduce job patterns (e.g., joins, aggregations, secondary sort)
- Performance considerations (partitioning, combiners, reducers)
- Clean, readable Java implementations

---

### 2) Airline On-Time Performance Analytics (Batch)
**Folder:** [`Airline On time Performance`](./Airline%20On%20time%20Performance)  
Batch analysis workflows over airline performance data (delays, cancellations, route-level metrics).

**Highlights (suggested):**
- Data cleaning + parsing at scale
- Deriving KPI-style aggregates (delay distributions, top routes, worst carriers)
- Reproducible jobs / scripts for repeat runs

---

### 3) MapReduce on MongoDB
**Folder:** [`MR on Mongo DB`](./MR%20on%20Mongo%20DB)  
Examples of using **MongoDB MapReduce** for server-side aggregation and analytics.

**Highlights (suggested):**
- Writing map/reduce functions for document-based aggregation
- Comparing MongoDB MapReduce vs. alternative aggregation approaches
- Handling schema variability in NoSQL datasets

---

### 4) MongoDB Fundamentals & Practice
**Folder:** [`Mongo DB 101`](./Mongo%20DB%20101)  
A fundamentals pack covering MongoDB basics and hands-on exercises.

**Highlights (suggested):**
- CRUD, indexing, data modeling basics
- Query patterns and performance intuition
- Small self-contained examples

---

### 5) NYSE Hadoop Program (Batch Analytics)
**Folder:** [`NYSE Hadoop Program`](./NYSE%20Hadoop%20Program)  
Batch processing/analytics style programs against NYSE/market datasets using Hadoop paradigms.

**Highlights (suggested):**
- Time-series style aggregation patterns
- Job pipelines that produce analysis-ready outputs
- Focus on correctness + scalability

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Java (primary), PigLatin (some)
- **Big Data:** Hadoop / MapReduce concepts
- **NoSQL:** MongoDB
- **Core strengths:** batch processing, data transformation, aggregation patterns, scalable computation

## ✅ How to use this repo

1. Browse the project folders above.
2. Each folder contains code and/or notes for that topic.
3. If you want to run anything locally, use the instructions inside the folder (or add a short `RUNBOOK.md` per folder).

> Tip: If you’re presenting this as a portfolio, add a short **“Results”** section inside each folder
> (what the job computes, sample outputs, and what you learned).

## ⭐ Portfolio Notes (what I’d tell an interviewer)

- I’m comfortable turning raw datasets into clean, aggregated outputs using scalable batch patterns.
- I understand distributed processing fundamentals (partitioning, reduce-side aggregation, avoiding skew).
- I can work across SQL/NoSQL-style thinking: document models and aggregation strategies.
